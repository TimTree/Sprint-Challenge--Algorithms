#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The runtime complexity is O(n). It takes n iterations to complete the function.

b)
The runtime complexity is O(nlogn). Each higher n increases the overtime expressed as a ratio, but not exponentially.

c)
The runtime complexity is O(nlogn). For each n, the rate of change of time to complete the function increases linearly.
## Exercise II

For each floor f, drop an egg. If the egg does not break, increment the floor. If it breaks, that's the floor. Should only break one egg.

Runtime complexity is O(n) because the amount of egg drop attempts is based on the number of floors needed to test.
